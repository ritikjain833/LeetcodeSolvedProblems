​
first give all to the b city and store the difference between the two cities costs. </br>
sort the difference array. </br>
iterate the difference array till the size/2 because that city b we can remove and add cost of city a to that.</br>
​
​
sum(cost(b))+cost(a)-cost(b) </br>
will cancel the cost(b) that was previously added and will add the minimum cost of city a.
