-Sort by attack in descending order and defense in ascending order. </br>
-one point to note here why we are sorting by defense in ascending if don't sort or by decreasing then some instances might be added like
10,4 ,10,3 which should not added in the result. </br>
To avoid this we perform sorting based on the ascending order. </br>
Another point to note that is we need to give only number of weak teams not no of pairs.
